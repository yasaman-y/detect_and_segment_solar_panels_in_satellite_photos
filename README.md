# detect_and_segment_solar_panels_in_satellite_photos
a CNN model to detect and segment solar panels in satellite photos






1- Generate a dataset
* collect ready data set
* create data set
    collect image
    label roof and panel


2 - Train a convolutional neural network (CNN)


-Try to do something interesting with the model



CNNs are quite powerful but without data, there is not much you can do.
